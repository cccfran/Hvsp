Description: Hierarchical community detection on networks by a recursive spectral partitioning strategy, which is shown to be effective and efficient in Li, Lei, Bhattacharyya, Sarkar, Bickel, and Levina (2018) <arXiv:1810.01509>. The package also includes a data generating function for a binary tree stochastic block model, a special case of stochastic block model that admits hierarchy between communities.
